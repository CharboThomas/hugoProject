Hello World, 

If you are in this web page, You want to know how am I?
So let's start the presentation.

During my free time, I love make sport like ice hockey, fencing, running or skiing. But also, I really enjoy make cyber security challenge in Root Me web site or traking strange signal with my hack RF one. Like the major part of my friend, I really enjoy play video games (like Battlefield 4 or War thunder) during my free time.


Study
-

Since my childhood, I know I want to become an engeneer on aerospace sector. This is for this reason why I join IPSA Paris after my highshool. 

During my engeneer school, I discover a lot of scientifc notions (like mecanic, material resistance, electronic or computer science). To be honnect, I really prefers computer science and electronic. For these 2 reasons, I choose to join the telecommunication unit of my school. Normally, after my study, I will become a telecommunication engeneer.

In the case of my study, I studied one semester at the Riga Technical University in Latvia. I choose to go to this unervisty because this university has a lot of telecommunication subject. During this semester, I studied how to creat an API with java, make database, creat a network and cryptology. I was very fun (exect the log down due to covid 19).

Due to my study, I developp a lot of skills in telecommunication : 
1. Computer Science : Python | Java | C/C++
2. Electronic : Arduino | FPGA/VHDL
3. Signal Processing : GNU Radio Companion | Matlab
4. Web : HTML/CSS | Javascript | RECT | VUE | PHP
5. Other : Linux (Fedora/Debian) | Office Pack (Word and Power Point) | Windobe 10 (:p)
