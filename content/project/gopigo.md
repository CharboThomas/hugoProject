description: " programming a robot with Python"
---

This is my first comuter science project. The goal of this project was to code a gopigo robot with Python3. 

{{< figure src="/gopigo.png" 
           alt="HackRF one equipment" position="center" 
           style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Gopigo Robot"captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: white;" 
>}}

During this project, we choose to create our own scratch GUI for "programming" or robot. in order to do that, we used TKinter and Gopigo libreary. At the end of the project, we had that : 

{{< figure src="/GUIgopigo1.png" 
           alt="HackRF one equipment" position="center" 
           style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="our own Gopigo GUI" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: white;" 
>}}

If we want to execute a special combinaison of actions, we need to select one button for each column. 

{{< figure src="/GUIgopigo2.png" 
           alt="HackRF one equipment" position="center" 
           style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="our own Gopigo GUI with actions" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: white;" 
>}}

In the picture, we can understand that : the robot will advance, for back, right, left,right.

For executing these actions, we need to select the button "Compilation"
