description: " Creation of a web site for a research project"
---

During my second year of engenering school, I choose to learn how to create a research. During my research, I learn how to use HTML/CSS with open classeromm mooc.

Before the end of the year, a teatcher contacted me for creating his website. 

After a lot of work hours, I created this website : 

{{< figure src="/p3d.png" 
           alt="HackRF one equipment" position="center" 
           style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="P3Î´ web site - Home Page" captionPosition="center" captionStyle="color: white;" 
>}}
